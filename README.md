This project tests the accuracy of a naive logistic regression model and a DNN for diagnosing whether a patient has a heart disease or not.

The models are trained on data from 1025 patients.

The logistic regression model achieved a training accuracy of 86.7% and a validation accuracy of 86.3%.

The DNN achieved a training accuracy of 100.0% and a validation accuracy of 100.0%.

Dependencies: numpy 1.22.2, pandas 1.3.2, matplotlib 3.3.4, tensorflow 2.8.0, sklearn 0.0.
